# content-guidelines
Check the issues in this repo. For each Guidelines / Best Practice we will create an issue.

Whenever someone in community is violating some guideline, we would link them to the relevant issue here. The issue should try to educate community member using examples on how to put the content on Objective.Earth

We are inspired from following platforms that offer guidelines to their community
